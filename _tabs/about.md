## **Welcome! It's great to see you...**

I'm Philip Ross, welcome to my little corner of the internet...

This site is a place for me to share anything, and everything.<br>
It's a place where I'll document my ideas, share updates on how I've achieved something I think is neat, explain technical details in (hopefully) - a simple way, and - wishfully - a place for me to share things with the community that I've been working on.


## **What is _The Digital Desk_?**

This site is designed to be a techincal blog and whilst it's very much in it's infancy, I wanted to be as broad as I can with what I work on.

I'm intending to use this as a space to share content from an IT Administrator perspective focussing on Digital Worker Experience technologies.<br>
Examples include:
- Apple Devices Management
- Zoom Communications technology administration
- Scripting and API integration (mainly with a focus on powershell)

I'm not aiming to be an oracle, I don't profess to be an expert by any stretch of the imagination, there are many people out there who know a great deal more than me!<br>
My ambition here is to challenge my own way of thinking, document my achievements - _and failures_ in the hope it's useful to others.

## **Who am I?**

My working life started in Supermarket retail. I had, and still have, a huge passion for Forumla One, and hoped to have a career within the motorsport industry.

However, life had other plans! Around the time of progressing my education to university, my learning style changed dramatically. No longer could I get a grasp on things quickly simply by reading a textbook. I needed to _do_ it, to understand it.

I had fully fledged into a kinesthetic learner.

This is where IT really came into the frame. I'd always had a penchant for IT, but had never really considered making a career within the IT industry. Out of the blue there was an opportunity to apply for a role on the internal IT service desk, which I grabbed with both hands. It was the best career decision I've taken so far, and quickly progressed from Junior 1st Line Analyst through to Senior 2nd Line analyst, before applying for a secondment into a 3rd Line delivery role.

And that's where I am today! My day-to-day involves working on various projects across a wide breadth of systems within the EUC/DWE space.

## **Thanks for being here...**

I'm hoping you find something useful on this site as it grows.

If you find something here that helps you tackle a problem in a new way, or squash a stubborn bug, then I'm achieving what I set out to.
